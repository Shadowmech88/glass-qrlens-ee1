QR Lens
==========

A QR code scanner for Glass.

Much of the code is based off of [BarcodeEye](https://github.com/barcodeeye/barcodeeye), and all credit for those portions remain there.

This application intends to be a more specific barcode scanner, focusing only on QR codes, since barcodes in general are difficult to scan on Glass.
