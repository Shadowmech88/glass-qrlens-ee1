QR Lens
==========

A QR code scanner for Glass.

Much of the code is based off of [BarcodeEye](https://github.com/barcodeeye/barcodeeye), and all credit for those portions remain there.

This application intends to be a more specific barcode scanner, focusing only on QR codes, since barcodes in general are difficult to scan on Glass.

This fork has been slightly altered to display correctly on the Google Glass Explorer Edition 1.
